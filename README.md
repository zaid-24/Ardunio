# Ardunio
Password Based Door Lock Security System Using Arduino &amp; Keypad
The circuit of this project is very simple which contains Arduino, keypad module, buzzer, Servo Motor, and LCD. Arduino controls the complete processes like taking a password from the keypad module, comparing passwords, driving buzzer, rotating servo motor, and sending status to the LCD display. The keypad is used for taking the password. The buzzer is used for indications. Servo motor is used for opening the gate while rotating and LCD is used for displaying status or messages on it.

 If the password is correct then open the lock by using servo motors and also glow a green LED.
A red led light is glown and buzzer is also played after every wrong attempt .

In the beginning the user has to enter the custom password using serial monitor and then after that whatever user will enter on the keypad will be displayed on the serial monitor with a message after entering pin whether it is correct or not.
